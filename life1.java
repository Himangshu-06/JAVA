// A variable is a container that holds data that can be changed during the execution of a program.
/* In Java, variables are used to store data values. Each variable has a specific type, which determines the size and layout of the variable's memory,
the range of values that can be stored in that memory, and the set of operations that can be applied to the variable
Variables are declared with a specific type and can be assigned values using the assignment operator (=)*/
