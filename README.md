## 📚 Resources I Use
I'm currently learning Java from [CodeWithHarry](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeWithHarry) on YouTube. His tutorials are beginner-friendly, well-structured, and explained in a very easy-to-understand way.

Some things I love about his channel:

🎥 Complete Java Playlist covering basics to advanced topics

📝 Handwritten notes that make revision super easy

💻 Real coding examples with step-by-step explanations

🔁 Repeated concepts to make sure they stick

📌 Hindi explanations for better understanding (if you're comfortable)

🌐 In addition to video tutorials, I regularly use the internet to deepen my understanding of various topics.
I explore official documentation, community forums like Stack Overflow, and websites such as GeeksforGeeks and W3Schools to clarify doubts and reinforce my learning.

>> For those who are beginning their Java journey, I highly recommend the following resource: [Java Tutorials for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu0W_9lII9agS67Uits0UnJyrYiXhDS6q) by CodeWithHarry. It offers a comprehensive and well-structured introduction to Java programming.



These resources collectively help me build a solid foundation as I continue progressing in Java development.
