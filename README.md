## 📚 Resources I Use

I'm currently learning Java from [CodeWithHarry](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeWithHarry) on YouTube. His tutorials are beginner-friendly, well-structured, and explained in a clear and practical manner.

Some key highlights of his channel:

- 🎥 A complete Java playlist covering topics from basics to advanced concepts  
- 📝 Handwritten notes that make revision straightforward  
- 💻 Real coding examples with step-by-step guidance  
- 🔁 Repetition of key concepts to reinforce understanding  
- 📌 Explanations in Hindi, which enhance clarity and accessibility for many learners

🌐 In addition to video tutorials, I also rely on various online resources to deepen my understanding. I frequently refer to:

- Official Java documentation  
- [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java/)  
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/java/)  
- Community forums like Stack Overflow

These sources help me explore different approaches, solve doubts, and reinforce what I learn.

> 💡 I highly recommend the [Java Tutorials for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu0W_9lII9agS67Uits0UnJyrYiXhDS6q) playlist by CodeWithHarry. It offers a comprehensive and well-structured introduction to Java programming—perfect for anyone starting their journey.
